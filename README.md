Not sure what this "game" is about yet, there isn't enough done to even call it a "game" yet.
So what am I planning to do?

- [x] Tile based map, generated from noise
  - [x] Basic "background" (water/grass/dirt)
  - [x] Trees and shrubs
- [x] "Infinite" size world, chunks loaded/unloaded on separate thread
- [x] Player character that you can move around the world
- [ ] Navmesh 
  - [x] Limit player movement to walkable areas
  - [ ] Properly account for size of player
  - [ ] Route finding
- [ ] Mobs and associated friendly/enemy behaviour
- [ ] Items and pickups
- [ ] Health and other systems
- [ ] UI layer
- [ ] Some idea for what game is actually about!
